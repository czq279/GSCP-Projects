# Governor's School for Computational Physics Projects

## Overview

These are my projects from the Governor’s School of Computational Physics. Using calculus-based approximation methods ranging from the Euler Method to the Runge-Kutta Method, I modeled simple physical phenomena.

## Basic information

- The first derivative of position is velocity and the second derivative is acceleration.
- All projects use classical mechanics.
- The kinetic energy of the modeled object is calculated with the equation K = ½mv2 where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity of the object.
